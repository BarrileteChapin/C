Problem: Finding the median element in an array of complex numbers in terms of their 
magnitudes. Note that the magnitude of a complex number (a + jb) is represented by the distance 
from the origin in an Argand diagram (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArgandDiagram.html). 

-----
Functionality:

Try to assign the following 7 complex numbers into an array, say A[7], using some member 
function of the class of “complex_number”. 

2+j7 4+j0 9+j4 8+j8 2+j4 5+j5 3+j2 

--------
 produce the following outcome on the computer screen: 
 
Original Array of Complex Numbers: 
 2+j7 4+j0 9+j4 8+j8 2+j4 5+j5 3+j2 
 
 The Median Element of the Array is: 5+j5y: 

 The mean is: ___
